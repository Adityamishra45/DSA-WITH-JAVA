Types of inheritance

1. Single inheritance (Like we did previously)
2. Multi-level inheritance (One derived child class can inherit the properties of the base class and another class can inherit the properties of the derived child class.)
3. Multiple inheritance (When one class is extending more than one class. But it is not supported in Java.)
4. Hierarchical inheritance (One class is inherited by many classes)
5. Hybrid inheritance (Combination of single and multiple inheritance. But not supported in Java)
