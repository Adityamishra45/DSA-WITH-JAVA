Q:- What is Polymorphism?
A:- Representing the same thing in the multiple way is known as Polymorphism.

Q:- When does the polymorphism occurs?
A:- It occurs in the inheritance.

Q:- What are the types of the polymorphism?
A:- 1> Compile time (static) polymorphism :- 
                                            This is achieved via method overloading (Same name of method but 
                                            types , arguments , order of the type and return type should be 
                                            different - Multiple constructor).

    2> Run Time (Dynamic) Polymorphism:-
                                            Achieved by method overriding (occurs when a subclass (child class)
                                            has the same method as the parent class - Like circle and square has 
                                            the same method (area) as the base class which is Shapes).=-\/7'

Q:- What is upcasting?
A:- Upcasting is the typecasting of a child object to a parent object. Upcasting gives us the flexibility to 
    access the parent class members but it is not possible to access all the child class members using this feature.   


*FINAL:- 
        You can not override a method which is final. So final keyword is use to prevent the overriding and 
        inheritance. We also cannot override the static method.


Q:- What is Binding?
A:- Binding refers to the process of converting identifiers(such as variable and performance names) into addresses.

Q:- What are the types of binding?
A:- 1> Early Binding :- 
                        Overloading is the example of early binding because it happens at the compile time.

    2> Late Binding :-
                        Overriding is the example of the late binding because it happens at the run time.
