Q:- What is Polymorphism?
A:- Representing the same thing in the multiple way is known as Polymorphism.

Q:- When does the polymorphism occurs?
A:- It occurs in the inheritance.

Q:- What are the types of the polymorphism?
A:- 1> Compile time (static) polymorphism :- 
                                            This is achieved via method overloading (Same name of method but 
                                            types , arguments , order of the type and return type should be 
                                            different - Multiple constructor).

    2> Run Time (Dynamic) Polymorphism:-
                                            Achieved by method overriding (occurs when a subclass (child class)
                                            has the same method as the parent class - Like circle and square has 
                                            the same method (area) as the base class which is Shapes).
